I want to make a raspi powered, openCV enhanced remote camera.
I know little about the topic, but my determination is at least average.
If you are looking for a good reason to facepalm real hard - tag along. 

Checkout my [Wiki](https://github.com/MikeRodziewicz/spy_eye/wiki) where I will try to keep captain's log of my failures.
